# Fluent-Validation PHPStan Rules

This is `sandermuller/laravel-fluent-validation-phpstan`, a PHPStan extension package that flags misuse of [`sandermuller/laravel-fluent-validation`](https://github.com/sandermuller/laravel-fluent-validation) in consumer projects. This is **not** a Laravel application — it is a standalone Composer package.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── Parser/            # Custom PHPStan node visitors (chain-metadata annotations)
├── Rules/             # PHPStan rules (one class per rule)
└── Traits/            # Shared traits (ChecksNamespace)
tests/
├── Rules/             # Tests for each rule (PHPStan RuleTestCase)
│   └── stubs/         # Test fixture PHP files referencing FluentRule
extension.neon         # PHPStan extension registration
phpstan.neon.dist      # PHPStan analysis configuration
pint.json              # Laravel Pint code style config
```

Companion packages:

- [`sandermuller/laravel-fluent-validation`](https://github.com/sandermuller/laravel-fluent-validation) — the runtime API these rules target.
- [`sandermuller/fluent-validation-rector`](https://github.com/sandermuller/fluent-validation-rector) — auto-fix counterpart for migration tasks.

## Dependencies

- **PHP**: ^8.2
- **PHPStan**: ^2.1.8
- `sandermuller/laravel-fluent-validation`: `^1.19` (dev-only; consumers supply their own installed version)

## Development Commands

```bash
composer test                # Run PHPUnit tests
composer fix-cs              # Run Laravel Pint formatter (alias: composer format)
composer phpstan             # Run PHPStan analysis
composer phpstan-clear-cache # Clear PHPStan cache
composer rector              # Run Rector transformations
composer qa                  # Run format, rector, phpstan, test
```

## Repository

- **Owner**: `sandermuller`
- **Repository**: `laravel-fluent-validation-phpstan`
- **Default branch**: `main`

---

## PHP Conventions

- Always use `declare(strict_types=1);`
- Use `private` visibility by default for methods, properties, and constants
- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion
- Always use explicit return type declarations
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for all method parameters
- Add a space after the unary not operator: `if (! $foo)`
- Omit docblocks when methods are fully type-hinted
- Prefer string interpolation over `sprintf` and concatenation
- Never use `empty()` — use explicit checks instead
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments

---

## Testing

- Tests use PHPStan's `RuleTestCase` base class
- Each rule has a corresponding test in `tests/Rules/`
- Test stubs (fixture PHP/Blade files) live alongside the tests in `stubs/` subdirectories
- Run all tests: `composer test`
- Run specific test: `vendor/bin/phpunit --filter=TestClassName`
- Every change must have test coverage — write or update tests, then run them

## Creating a New Rule

1. Create the rule class in `src/Rules/` implementing PHPStan's `Rule<T>` interface
2. Register it in `extension.neon` — under `rules:` if the rule has no constructor dependencies, or under `services:` with the `phpstan.rules.rule` tag when it needs DI (e.g. `ReflectionProvider`)
3. Create test stub files in `tests/Rules/stubs/` (or a sibling `stubs/` directory next to the test)
4. Create a test extending `PHPStan\Testing\RuleTestCase` in `tests/Rules/`
5. Use the `ChecksNamespace` trait if the rule needs to filter by namespace prefix
6. Run `composer fix-cs` and `composer phpstan` before finalizing

## Quality Standards

- PHPStan level: `max`
- Type coverage: 100% (return, param, property, declare)
- Cognitive complexity: class max 12, function max 10
- Code style: Laravel Pint with `laravel` preset

# Package Boost Guidelines

These guidelines replace Laravel Boost's default foundation for
repositories that ship as Composer packages — Laravel-targeted or
framework-agnostic. The framing, tooling, and trade-offs differ from
application development; follow this version when working inside a
package codebase.

## Foundational Context

This codebase is a **Composer package**, not an application. The rules
below hold regardless of which framework (if any) the package targets.

- There is no `app/`, `bootstrap/`, `routes/`, `.env`, or database by
  default. Tooling that assumes an application context (e.g. running
  `php artisan` against the package itself) does not apply.
- The primary artefact is the package's public API — entry-point
  classes, service providers, exposed contracts. Everything else is
  scaffolding.
- Downstream consumers depend on this package via Composer. Every
  public change is a user-facing API change governed by semver.
- `composer.json` is the source of truth for supported PHP versions
  and any framework constraints. Check `require.php` (and any
  `require.<framework>/*` entries) before using version-specific
  features.

## Source Layout

- `src/` — package source, PSR-4 autoloaded per `composer.json`
- `tests/` — Pest or PHPUnit suite
- `config/` — publishable defaults shipped with the package, when
  applicable
- `resources/` — views, translations, Boost skills / guidelines, when
  applicable
- `database/migrations`, `database/factories` — only if the package
  ships them
- `workbench/` — developer-only Testbench scaffolding when Testbench
  is in use; never shipped

Check sibling files before inventing structure. Do not introduce new
top-level directories without a clear reason.

## Tests Are the Specification

The package has no running application to click through. Tests are how
behaviour is pinned down.

- Write tests alongside any behavioural change.
- Do not create "verification scripts" when a test can prove the same
  thing.
- Run the project's configured test runner (`vendor/bin/pest` or
  `vendor/bin/phpunit`) before claiming a change is done.

## Public API Discipline

- Every `public`, `protected`, or exported symbol is part of the
  package's surface. Breaking changes require a major version bump.
- Prefer `final` classes and `private`/`@internal` markers for
  anything not intended for extension.
- Keep config keys, published asset paths, and service container
  bindings stable across patch and minor versions.

## Conventions

- Match existing code style, naming, and structural patterns — check
  sibling files before writing new ones.
- Use descriptive names (`resolvePublishDestination`, not `resolve()`).
- Reuse existing helpers before adding new ones.
- Do not add dependencies without approval; every new `require` is a
  constraint downstream consumers inherit.

## Documentation Files

Only create or edit documentation (README, CHANGELOG, docs/) when
explicitly requested or when a behaviour change requires it.

## Replies

Be concise. Focus on what changed and why. Skip restating what the
diff already shows.

## If your package targets Laravel

The rest of this document is Laravel-specific. Skip it if the package
is framework-agnostic — `composer.json` should make that obvious (no
`require.illuminate/*`, no `require.laravel/framework`).

### Laravel context

A Testbench-provided Laravel application is spun up only at test
time. Base test case is `Orchestra\Testbench\TestCase`.
`composer.json`'s `require.illuminate/*` (or
`require.laravel/framework`) defines the supported Laravel range —
check it before using version-specific framework APIs.

### Use `vendor/bin/testbench`, not `php artisan`

Running artisan commands directly against the package fails — there is
no host application. Use Testbench's binary:

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `php artisan test` | `vendor/bin/pest` or `vendor/bin/phpunit` |
| `php artisan tinker` | `vendor/bin/testbench tinker` |
| `php artisan make:*` | Create files manually under `src/` |
| `php artisan vendor:publish` | `vendor/bin/testbench vendor:publish` |

#### Commands that require `laravel/boost`

These only apply when the package has `laravel/boost` as a dev
dependency. Skip if Boost isn't installed — `boost sync`
prints a warning and moves on.

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `php artisan boost:install` | `vendor/bin/testbench boost:install` |
| `php artisan boost:mcp` | `vendor/bin/testbench boost:mcp` |

Register the package's service provider in `testbench.yaml` under
`providers:` so Testbench boots it. Published files land in
`workbench/` by default, not `config/` or `resources/` of a host app.

### Cross-Version Compatibility

Supporting multiple Laravel / PHP majors is routine for Laravel
packages. Activate `cross-version-laravel-support` **before** writing
the code; activate `ci-matrix-troubleshooting` **after** a matrix cell
has failed.

## Release Notes vs CHANGELOG

`CHANGELOG.md` is **auto-populated by CI** on release. Do not hand-edit it.

When you need to document a user-facing change for a release, write it to `RELEASE_NOTES_<version>.md` at the repo root (already gitignored via the `RELEASE_NOTES*.md` pattern). The CI release job picks it up and promotes it into `CHANGELOG.md` as part of the tag flow.

If you find yourself editing `CHANGELOG.md` directly, stop — it will be overwritten.

## Verification Before Completion

Before claiming any work is complete or successful, run the verification command fresh and confirm the output. Evidence before claims, always.

### Required Before Any Completion Claim

1. **Run** the relevant command (in the current message, not from memory)
2. **Read** the full output
3. **Confirm** it supports the claim
4. **Then** state the result with evidence

### During Development (after each change)

| Claim            | Required verification                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Code style clean | `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` output    |
| Tests pass       | Related tests pass via `--filter` or specific file |
| Bug fixed        | Previously failing test now passes                 |

### At Completion Only (feature/phase done, before PR)

These are slow checks — only run them once at the very end:

| Claim             | Required verification                                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rector ran clean  | `vendor/bin/rector process` showing 0 changes                   |
| PHPStan clean     | `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=2G` showing 0 errors |
| Full suite passes | `vendor/bin/pest` output showing 0 failures                     |
| Feature complete  | All above checks pass                                           |

### Always Capture Command Output

Append `|| true` to all verification commands (tests, linting, type checks) so the output is always captured, even on failure. Without it, a non-zero exit code can hide the output, forcing an expensive second run just to read the errors.

```bash
# CORRECT — output always visible
vendor/bin/pest --filter=testName || true
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent || true

# WRONG — output lost on failure, wastes time re-running
vendor/bin/pest --filter=testName
```

### Never Use Without Evidence

- "should work now"
- "that should fix it"
- "looks correct"
- "I'm confident this works"

These phrases indicate missing verification. Run the command first, then report what actually happened.
